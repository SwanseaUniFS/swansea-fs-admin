## This Repository
This repo is meant to be for an overview of what we're doing. I intend to have UML diagrams of how the components interact, who is assigned to what. I will create a thing with github projects to actually track what needs doing but this'll do for now.


# General stuff
Need to close most of the branches in swansea-fs-esp32-dash so we only have a small number (main, no-flashing, etc)

# Coding stuff.
esp32 dash
update code performance

esp32 boards
get hat's connected, and run code without lvgl.
make code for transmitting.

pico cowbell
rewrite code to transmit

pico can b
move default code so it can be used as an import
make main just run whichever file is specified, so main doesn't have to be rewritten.

raspberry pi
screen
telemetry
video
other stuff (gps?)

website
fix bugs in changing size.


PUT PICTURE OF DEVICE IN REPOSITORY SO WE KNOW WHAT RELATES TO WHAT.
